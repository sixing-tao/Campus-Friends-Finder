# Campus Friends Path Visualization Application

This project extends the campus map application by adding a new feature that allows users to identify nearby friends along their walking paths. This helps users plan their routes and discover opportunities to meet friends without deviating from their regular paths.
This is the Final Project for CSE331.

## Features

- **User Login**: Users can log in to select their identity.
- **Friend Selection**: After logging in, users can choose friends from a list.
- **Schedule Management**: Users can input their daily schedules. The system assumes users remain at a location until 10 minutes before the next activity, during which they walk between locations.
- **Path Visualization**: Users can view their walking path for a specified time range, displayed on the map with labeled endpoints.
- **Friend Intersections**: The app displays locations where friends’ walking paths intersect with the user’s path during the same time range.
